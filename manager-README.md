# Hi, I’m Chris Seifert
(pronounced SIGH-fert)
	
## What is this?
The point of this README is to introduce myself and give you an idea of how I think, how I work and answer some questions you might have about me. This is a living document so it ~~may~~ will change over time as necessary.

## What is this not?
This is not going to lay out my expectations of you or how I think the organization or any particular project should be run.

**We've likely just met. We need to get to know one another.**

## Who am I?
I live in the Junction with my wife (Kim), son (Darius) and our dog (Hennessey). I was born and grew up in the US in Kansas City, Missouri (**not Kansas**)  and moved to Toronto way back in 2005. I’m a sports fan, comic book geek, board game player, photographer, video gamer, woodworker and drink way too much Coke Zero.

My technical background is primarily in back end development. I’ve been in web dev since 1996 and most of those years have been working in the LAMP stack (PHP). I've primarily worked for agencies of various sizes throughout my career. Two jobs ago I worked for an agency called Ariad which did very similar work to what we do at Klick (websites, banners, emails, etc), mostly for financial and healthcare organizations. It will be interesting for me to discover the similarities and differences between the two companies.

After Ariad I worked at Rangle.io, a dev shop turned full service agency whose primary focus was almost entirely on modern javascript frameworks (Angular, React, Vue, etc). We also spread out to working on design systems, devops, analytics and machine learning. The client base was pretty diverse, Rangle doesn't have a hyperfocus on one vertical like Klick does with healthcare.

I'm very much looking forward to understanding how things are done at Klick, what we're great at, what we could do better and so on. There is plenty for me to learn from you and I will bring plenty for you to learn from. It’s going to be great!

Whew. More than enough about me. Let’s talk about us.

## Communication
My style is one of transparency and candor. You can ask me anything you want and I will answer to the best of my ability. Sometimes I won't be able to speak about something due to confidentiality or other similar concerns but otherwise you will get my honest opinion about whatever you ask. 

I have a tendency to be very direct. Some people like that but for others it can come across as abrupt. It's something I'm working on. I've been told my default demeanor is that I tend to look severe or unapproachable but that's just my face, I promise! I'm actually generally quite laid back and happy to talk about anything. If you want to chat, please do, I would love that :)

I am usually available on Slack and I try to respond quickly whenever possible. The only reasons you won’t get a response back from me within a few hours (if not minutes) are things like if I:

  1. Am sleeping.
  2. Am in a very long meeting (or series of meetings) that requires my full attention.
  3. Am stuck in the subway.
  4. Am on vacation and my wife has hidden my phone for using Slack too much.
  5. Don’t get a notification from Slack on my phone for hours. This used to happen more often but hasn't been as much of a problem after upgrading my phone.

There are very few things that I will do at Klick that are more important than talking with you if you need to talk to me. Slack me, email me, drop by my desk, grab time in my calendar. If you don’t find time in my calendar, message me and I’ll make time.

Sometimes I like to get some work done on the weekends. Assuming it's not marked as urgent, if I message you on the weekend, **I don't expect you to respond**. I don't expect you to work on weekends unless something has been planned ahead of time. I want you to enjoy your life outside of the office so that you're happy, healthy and focused when you are at Klick.

## Feedback
The importance of feedback to me cannot be overstated. I need feedback. You need feedback. We need to make sure that we are regularly communicating feedback candidly because we can’t make good choices if we don’t understand the actual context of the choice.

My primary goal is for you to be happy, fulfilled and doing good work. You should never be afraid to provide feedback to me or come to me with any concerns. Your success is my success and it’s in both our best interests to tackle any problems that might be happening for you so that you can move forward.

## One-on-ones (1:1s)
I’m a big believer in the importance of 1:1s. I will always make time for these meetings no matter how crazy my schedule might look.  The exception to that is if one of us is on vacation and we can’t schedule around that.

**These are your meetings**. This is time for you to talk about whatever you want with me and have my undivided attention. That means these meetings will be more productive if you bring topics, concerns or just thoughts. My preference is for these not to be status updates (what you’re currently working on) and more about topics of substance.

For the first few weeks of us getting to know one another, we’re going to meet weekly if you report directly to me. If you report indirectly to me, we'll likely start out meeting biweekly. The first time we meet will be for an hour and then we’ll switch to half hour meetings in the weeks following. If, after some time, we mutually agree that we should do these less often, we can alter that schedule.

All of that said, if there is something that is urgent that we need to talk about, don’t wait for the next 1-1. **Let me know ASAP.**

## Welp
That's about it. I hope this sheds at least a little light on me and how I like to work. As I hope I've made clear above, if you have any questions, please don't hesitate and message me! I'm excited to get to know you and work with you :)
