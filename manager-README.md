# Hi, I’m Chris Seifert
(pronounced SIGH-fert)
	
## What is this?
The point of this README is to introduce myself and give you an idea of how I think, how I work and answer some questions you might have about me. This is a living document so it ~~may~~ will change over time as necessary.

## What is this not?
This is not going to lay out my expectations of you or how I think the organization or any particular project should be run.

**I just got here, I don’t know much yet.**

## Who am I?
I live in the Junction with my wife (Kim), son (Darius) and our dog (Hennessey). I was born and grew up in the US in Kansas City, Missouri (**not Kansas**)  and moved to Toronto way back in 2005. I’m a sports fan, comic book geek, board game player, woodworker and drink way too much Coke Zero.

My technical background is primarily in back end development. I’ve been in web dev since 1996 and most of those years have been working in the LAMP stack (PHP). Rangle is my first job where front end development is the focus and my prior experience with javascript was generally along the lines of, “Hey we need this doohickey to be dynamic and move around and stuff. Let’s figure out how it’s done by searching Google and Stack Overflow!”

This means I have a lot to learn in JS and front end dev, which is one of the things that attracted me to Rangle. I love to learn new (to me) technologies and this is a challenge I’m enjoying. That said, as a result of my relative newness to JS, **I will inevitably say some dumb things or ask some dumb questions**. Try not to laugh at me too much, I’ll get there! 

I have no doubt that there is plenty for me to learn from you and I will bring plenty for you to learn from. It’s going to be great!

Whew. More than enough about me. Let’s talk about us.

## Communication
My style is one of transparency and candor. You can ask me anything you want and I will answer to the best of my ability. Sometimes the company will require that I can’t speak about something but otherwise you will get my honest opinion about whatever you ask. 

I try to always be available on Slack at anytime. The only reasons you won’t get a response back from me within a few hours (if not minutes) are things like if I:

  1. Am sleeping.
  2. Am in a very long meeting (or series of meetings) that requires my full attention.
  3. Am stuck in the subway.
  4. Am on vacation and my wife has hidden my phone for using Slack too much.
  5. Don’t get a notification from Slack on my phone for hours. This actually 
happens frustratingly more often than one would think. Might be time for a 
new phone.

There are very few things that I will do at Rangle that are more important than talking with you if you need to talk to me. Slack me, email me, drop by my desk (L26), grab time in my calendar. If you don’t find time in my calendar, message me and I’ll make time.

Sometimes I like to get some work done on the weekends. Assuming it's not marked as urgent, if I message you on the weekend, **I don't expect you to respond**. I don't expect you to work on weekends unless something has been planned ahead of time. I want you to enjoy your life outside of the office so that you're happy, healthy and focused when you are at Rangle.

## Feedback
The importance of feedback to me cannot be overstated. I need feedback. You need feedback. We need to make sure that we are regularly communicating feedback candidly because we can’t make good choices if we don’t understand the actual context of the choice.

My primary goal as your manager is for you to be happy, fulfilled and doing good work. You should never be afraid to provide feedback to me or come to me with any concerns. Your success is my success and it’s in both our best interests to tackle any problems that might be happening for you so that you can move forward.

## One-on-ones (1-1s)
I’m a big believer in the importance of 1-1s. I will always make time for these meetings no matter how crazy my schedule might look.  The exception to that is if one of us is on vacation and we can’t schedule around that.

**These are your meetings**. This is time for you to talk about whatever you want with me and have my undivided attention. That means these meetings will be more productive if you bring topics, concerns or just thoughts. My preference is for these not to be status updates (what you’re currently working on) and more about topics of substance.

I will create a private Slack channel for you to dump topics into so that we have a central place to refer to when we sit down together. If there is something I think is important that we should talk about, I will add it there as well.

For the first few weeks of us getting to know one another, we’re going to meet weekly. The first time we meet will be for an hour and then we’ll switch to half hour meetings in the weeks following. If, after some time, we mutually agree that we should do these less often, we can alter that schedule.

All of that said, if there is something that is urgent that we need to talk about, don’t wait for the next 1-1. **Let me know ASAP.**
